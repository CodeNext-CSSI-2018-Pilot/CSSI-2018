// We will represent a tic-tac-toe board as a 2D array with three rows and three columns.
// At the start, each spot in each array will be filled in with a space: " "
// When players make their moves, we will replace the spaces with either "X" or "O".

// isGameOver (return "X", "O", "tie" or null)
// checkRows
// checkColumns
// checkDiagonals
// getMove
// Must check if the spot is empty, and if the numbers are inbounds
// Can skip the validation at first, but could lead to trouble
// Greeting
// Take turns inputting moves
// Always check if game is over
