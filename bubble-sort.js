// Bubble sort uses nested for loops.
// Each for loop should only go up to the second-to-last element.
// Inside the inner for loop, check if each item is larger than the item that follows it in the array.
// If it is swap the items by doing something like this:
// let temp = arr[j];
// arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
// arr[j + 1] = temp;

// The outer loop doesn't do anything in particular.
// It just makes sure that the inner loop is run many (arr.length - 1) times.
// After this process happens that many times, the array should be sorted.

// You can test it out with this.
arr = [2, 6, 1, 3, 8, 5, 7];
